**pyodc** is a Python interface to `odc`_ for encoding/decoding ODB-2 files.

The package contains two different implementations of the same library:

.. index:: pyodc

* **pyodc** is a pure Python encoder and decoder for ODB-2 data, which encodes data from, and decodes it into pandas data frames

.. index:: codc

* **codc** is an implementation of the same API as **pyodc** that depends on the ECMWF **odc** library, and comes with *much* better performance
